<Text id="player_awakening">Good Morning Sir/Madam.
It is currently 22 degrees celsius outside with a chance of light showers. If you look in your closet there will be a suitable outfit for today.
There have been 3 local car accidents overnight. Please drive carefully.
My research shows that assault rates have risen 2 percent in the past week.
It certainly is a dangerous world out there.</Text>
